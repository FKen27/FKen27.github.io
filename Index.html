<h1>Rainbow LOOΠΔ </h1>
<p>"Every day, there’s a flash in my heart
A shining rainbow
A colorless world is boring
Will you change it with your fingers?
Red, orange, yellow, green, even thicker, be okay?" -ViViD </p>


<h3>Rainbows and prisms are important to Loona for a few reasons:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Aesthetic</li>
<li>the signature colours</li>
<li>Lyrically</li>

</ul>

<p>Storywise rainbows will probably be important as all members have a specific colour, which are always shown in someway. Just like moons are shown in Odd Eye Circle MVs Rainbows will perhaps show up a lot in the full debut of the group.</p>
